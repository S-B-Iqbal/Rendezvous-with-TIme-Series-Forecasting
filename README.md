# Rendezvous-with-Time-Series-Forecasting

## Introduction    

This Repository attempts to demonstrate modern Neural Networking tools to forecast Time Series data using Python.    


## Motivation    

- In majority of the real-world problems it is difficult to estimate the seasonality of the data, gauge the trend or ensure stationarity.
- In traditional statistical approaches, it is essential to specify the assumptions of the model. For Instance, the right sort of trend(linear, non-linear, local or global)
- The ability of neural networks because of which we don't need to specify the relationship (linear, non-linear, seasonality, trend) that exist between input and output layer.

## Dataset

- Google's historical stock prices are collected from the following [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/goog/historical) link as a csv.
